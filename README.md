This custom integration provides comprehensive monitoring and control of Eveus EV chargers in Home Assistant, featuring advanced state tracking, current control, energy monitoring, and improved SOC tracking.

## Prerequisites

### Required Helper Entities
Before installing the integration, you must create these helper entities in Home Assistant:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Helpers
2. Click the "+ CREATE HELPER" button
3. Choose "Number"
4. Create each of these helpers with the exact input_number names:

```yaml
input_number:
  ev_battery_capacity:
    name: "EV Battery Capacity"
    min: 10
    max: 160
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:car-battery
    # Initial value should match your EV's battery capacity

  ev_initial_soc:
    name: "Initial EV State of Charge"
    min: 0
    max: 100
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:battery-charging-40
    # Set this before each charging session

  ev_soc_correction:
    name: "Charging Efficiency Loss"
    min: 0
    max: 10
    step: 0.1
    initial: 7.5     # Default efficiency loss
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:chart-bell-curve
    # Adjust based on your observed charging efficiency

  ev_target_soc:
    name: "Target SOC"
    min: 80
    max: 100
    step: 10
    initial: 80      # Default target
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:battery-charging-high
    # Adjust based on your charging needs
```

Alternatively, you can add these helpers via YAML by adding the above configuration to your `configuration.yaml`.

> **Important**: The integration will verify these helpers exist during setup and display an error if any are missing or incorrectly configured.
